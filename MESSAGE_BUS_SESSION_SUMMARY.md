# Message Bus Implementation Session Summary

## Context
User had a complete distributed message bus system already implemented but encountered errors when trying to use it instead of Task Master orchestration.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Component Object Resolution Error
**Problem**: `WARNING [declarative_router]: Invalid 'to:' configuration type: <class 'woodwork.components.llms.openai.openai'>`
**Fix**: Updated `DeclarativeRouter._extract_targets()` to handle component objects with `.name` attribute and convert to strings.

### 2. Task Master vs Message Bus Conflict  
**Problem**: Both Task Master and message bus were running simultaneously.
**Fix**: Added global flag `message_bus_active` in `woodwork/globals.py` and modified `cli/main.py` to skip Task Master when message bus is active.

### 3. Missing Main Loop
**Problem**: Process ended when Task Master was disabled - no main event loop.
**Fix**: Created `start_message_bus_loop()` and `message_bus_main_loop()` in `cli/main.py` to replace Task Master's input/output cycle.

### 4. Component Constructor Issues
**Problem**: `'command_line' object has no attribute 'output_targets'` - MessageBusIntegration mixin not initialized.
**Fixes**:
- Updated `parser/config_parser.py` to include `name`, `component`, `type` in config
- Fixed `components/inputs/inputs.py` constructor to properly call parent
- Fixed `MessageBusIntegration.__init__()` to extract config from nested dict structure

### 5. Event Routing Issues  
**Problem**: `input_received` events weren't being routed to target components.
**Fixes**:
- Added `input_received` to routable events in `_should_route_event()`
- Updated `_extract_output_targets()` to convert component objects to string names
- Fixed JSON payload creation using `InputReceivedPayload`

## Key Files Modified
- `woodwork/cli/main.py` - Added message bus main loop, disabled Task Master conditionally
- `woodwork/parser/config_parser.py` - Added component metadata to config, set global flag
- `woodwork/components/inputs/inputs.py` - Fixed constructor chain
- `woodwork/core/message_bus/integration.py` - Fixed config extraction, event routing, component object handling
- `woodwork/core/message_bus/declarative_router.py` - Added built-in component validation

## Current Status
✅ Message bus initializes and starts successfully  
✅ Input routing works (`input → ag`)  
✅ Console output inference works (when no explicit output)  
✅ Component object resolution works  
✅ Main loop keeps process alive  

## Next Steps
- Test complete end-to-end flow: input → LLM processing → console output
- Verify streaming output works through message bus console handler
- Test with more complex routing configurations

## Usage
Run with existing `.ww` configs - message bus will automatically activate and replace Task Master orchestration.
